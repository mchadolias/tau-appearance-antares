# Tau Neutrino Appearance with ANTARES
- - -

This repo contains the work that is accomplished with SWIM for the statistical analysis. 

## reconstruction_perfomance
This folder contains an initial study for perfoming an analysis in the perfomance of the available reconstructions both availble from the AntDSTs and NNfit.

### Remark:
Previously, this repo contained all the work for my master thesis, however due to the fact there were a lot of things irrelevant to the purpose of the repository, it has been split to several more specific repositories.
